# AutoVAI
A convolutional neural network-based design of defect detection system. The main purpose of this work was the realization of a prototype of an automated defects detection system in production.
  
The  system is composed of three main subsystems, first the electronic subsystem 
which control the robotic arm and the conveyor belt including motors and sensors, secondly a mechanical 
subsystem which include the conveyor belt, robotic arm and the frame, finally the software subsystem which is 
the important part in the system which is a smart system that performs through quality checks down to the fines details. 

## Electronic Subsystem
